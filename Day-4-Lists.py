# This question combines several of the Python List concepts that we‚Äôve seen in the previous lessons in isolation. If the code above is at all confusing, I recommend breaking down what‚Äôs going on using several print statements using repl.it. First, try printing out:

# print(dirty_dozen)
# Then print out:

# print(dirty_dozen[0])
# print(dirty_dozen[1])
# To see what happens at the next stage print out:

# print(dirty_dozen[1][2])
# print(dirty_dozen[1][3])
# I hope this helps clarify how nested lists work. üôÇ
